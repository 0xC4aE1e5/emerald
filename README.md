# ðŸŸ¢ Emerald ðŸŸ¢

This is Emerald. A fast programming language.

## Installing

### Windows

Emerald is written in Ruby, so you need Ruby.

1.  Install Ruby using [RubyInstaller](//rubyinstaller.org).
2.  Run `main.rb`
3.  Test it out by typing:

<!-- -->

    print Hello, Emerald!

Note that the extra tools won't be installed.

### Linux

Just build it from source:

    make
    sudo make install

Note that it will install the extra tools. If you don't want those, run
this:

    make emerald
    sudo cp emerald /usr/local/bin

No `.configure`.
