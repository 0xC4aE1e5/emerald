# ðŸŸ¢ Emerald ðŸŸ¢ [modules](https://codeberg.org/brahma/emerald-libs-exts)

This is Emerald. A fast programming language.

## Installing

### Windows

Emerald is written in Ruby, but the installer installs Ruby for you.

1. Run `install.ps1`
2. Run `emerald` in CMD

Note that the extra tools won't be installed.

### Linux

Just build it from source:

    make
    sudo make install

Note that it will install the extra tools. If you don't want those, run
this:

    make emerald
    sudo cp emerald /usr/local/bin

No `.configure`.
