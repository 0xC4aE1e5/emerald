    <h1>What is Emerald?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Emerald is a programming language that is very minimal and does not need a lot of resources. It's built on top of Crystal.
      You can try it out by making a Emerald script called 
      <code>hworld.em
      </code> and put this in the file:
    <pre>
say Hello, World!
</pre>
    and then compiling and running Emerald with 
    <code>hworld.em
    </code> as the argument.
